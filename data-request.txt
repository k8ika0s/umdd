UMDD Data Request Guide
=======================

Goal: acquire real mainframe-origin datasets to train/evaluate codepage detection, field typing, boundary detection, and translation heads. We need RDW/BDW-aware byte streams with known codepages and, ideally, structural hints.

What “good” looks like
- Raw bytes, not pre-converted to ASCII/UTF-8.
- RDW- or BDW-prefixed records, or fixed-length records with known LRECL.
- Known EBCDIC codepage per file (e.g., CP037, CP1047, CP500, CP273). If unknown, note that explicitly.
- Mixed-mode content: text + packed decimal (COMP-3), binary ints (COMP/COMP-5), and zoned decimal, including signed overpunch.
- Variety of layouts: copybook-aligned flat files, VSAM (KSDS/ESDS/RS), SMF excerpts if permissible, MQ/CICS payloads if available.
- Metadata: LRECL/RECFM if fixed; RDW/BDW presence if variable; any copybook/CICS/MQ headers; field dictionaries if available.

Minimum dataset asks (per codepage if possible)
- 3–5 files per codepage (CP037, CP1047, CP500, CP273) with ≥10K records each.
- At least one file with:
  - Packed decimals (COMP-3) including negative values.
  - Binary integers (COMP/COMP-5) with multi-byte fields.
  - Zoned decimals with signed overpunch (positive/negative).
  - Mixed text/binary in the same record.
- Optional but valuable: SMF extracts, MQ payload samples, VSAM unloads (keyed and non-keyed), and any dataset with embedded dates (CYYMMDD, YYDDD).

Format and delivery
- Provide as binary files on shared storage (no transcoding to ASCII/UTF-8).
- Organize by codepage under `data/real/<CODEPAGE>/filename.bin` if feasible.
- Include a short README/manifest per file with:
  - Codepage (or “unknown” if not sure).
  - RECFM (F/FB/V/VB) and LRECL if known.
  - Whether RDW/BDW prefixes are present.
  - Any available copybook snippets or field descriptions.
  - Presence of packed decimal, binary ints, zoned decimals, dates.

Privacy/compliance
- No PII/PCI/PHI. If data must be realistic, use de-identified or synthetic-but-schema-accurate samples generated internally.
- If masking is applied, note which fields are masked and how (nulling, hashing, shuffling).

Why we need this
- Codepage head: needs real EBCDIC variation and mixed-mode bytes to generalize beyond synthetic.
- Field typing/boundary heads: need authentic packed/zoned/binary patterns and real-world record heterogeneity.
- Translator head: benefits from real text segments with domain-specific vocab (CICS/MQ/DB2/SMF) and mixed encodings.

Fallback (if real data cannot be shared)
- Internal synthetic generation matching your schemas: share copybooks/field specs so we can synthesize realistic RDW datasets that mirror field types and distributions without real values.
